ðŸš€ My First Step into DevOps: Setting Up NGINX on an Azure Virtual Machine! ðŸ”¥
I just completed DevOps Stage 0 - NGINX Configuration as part of the ATC Africa Mentorship Program/Internship, and Iâ€™m excited to share my experience! ðŸŽ‰
This task involved launching a VM on Azure, setting up an NGINX web server on Ubuntu, configuring it to serve a custom HTML page, and ensuring it was publicly accessible.
ðŸ”¹ Challenges Faced
One major hurdle I encountered was creating an SSH key for my VM. Initially, I generated a .ppk key instead of a .pem, which caused authentication errors when trying to connect to my server. After troubleshooting, I successfully created the correct .pem key and gained access!
ðŸ”¹ What I Learned
âœ… Launching an Ubuntu VM on Azure.
âœ… Installing and configuring NGINX on Ubuntu
âœ… Using nano to edit my HTML file inside /var/www/html/index.html
âœ… Troubleshooting SSH authentication errors
âœ… Understanding how web servers serve static content
This hands-on experience was an eye-opener into the world of DevOps, system administration, and cloud computing. Setting up NGINX on AWS gave me a deeper appreciation of how cloud infrastructure works behind the scenes.
ðŸ’¡ Key Takeaways for Beginners:
When launching a VM, always download and store the .pem key securely
NGINX is a powerful, lightweight web serverâ€”great for learning DevOps fundamentals
Debugging is an essential skillâ€”every mistake is an opportunity to learn!
A big thank you to the ATC Africa for this amazing learning opportunity! ðŸ™Œ
